# Arrays
Arrays are fixed lists where elements are the same data type

### Declaring and Defining Arrays
Data type must be specified before assigning values

# Vectors
Vectors are essentially resizable arrays. They are stack allocated. 
## Defining a vector

## Adding values to a vector
Because vectors are resizable, we can use [[Functions#push (vector)|push]] to add new elements to the end of a vector

## Looping through vector elements

### Accessing elements of arrays and vectors
Accessing elements of an array works much the same as it does in other languages
for example `example_array[0]` is the first element in the array
