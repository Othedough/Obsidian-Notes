# Unit Testing
unittest is a standard library framework for unit testing

"Tests written using the `unittest` module can help you find bugs in your programs, and prevent regressions from occurring as you change your code over time. Teams adhering to [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) may find `unittest` useful to ensure all authored code has a corresponding set of tests."" - [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-unittest-to-write-a-test-case-for-a-function-in-python)

## test-driven development (TDD):
- more broadly, TDD is:
	- a [software development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process "Software development process") relying on software requirements being converted to [test cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case "Test case") before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later." [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
