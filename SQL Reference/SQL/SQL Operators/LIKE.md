LIKE is an operator used with [[WHERE]] clause to search for a specific pattern in a column. 
For example 

	WHERE name LIKE 'se_ven' 
	will reveal both 'seven' and 'Se7en'

Here, the underscore means you can substitute any individual character here without breaking the pattern. 

NOTE: LIKE is _not_ case sensitive.
